# MyPlan

A long-term learning and development roadmap focused on **Lua and its ecosystem**.  
This plan is designed to master Lua-based technologies, toolkits, and runtimes through **continuous practice and real projects**.

> 🚀 **Commitment**  
> I will build projects using **all of these tools and devkits**, and I aim to create **at least one project every week** as part of this journey.

---

## Goals

- Master Lua and its advanced runtimes
- Build reusable devkits and toolchains
- Create real projects (CLI tools, GUI apps, game tools, and system utilities)
- Develop strong problem-solving and architecture skills using Lua
- Become highly productive and professional in Lua-based development

## Project Strategy

For each tool or devkit:
1. Learn the fundamentals
2. Build a practical project
3. Publish and document the project
4. Review, refactor, and improve the code
5. Apply best practices and performance optimizations

> 📅 **Weekly Rule:**  
> At least **one project will be built every week**, even if it is small or experimental.

---

## Status

This roadmap is active and evolving.  
Progress, projects, and experiments will be continuously added and improved.
